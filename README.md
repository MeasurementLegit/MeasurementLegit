# :wave: Hello Everyone! Take as much time as you want!

There's no time limit, feel free to see my profile as long as you want. Well, I am Geronimo Klokowski, a German teenager. I am 13 years old and found my hobby in programming about 2 years ago. Besides programming I also like to play video games or spend time with my friends.

My goal is to be a **developer for a big company e.g. Google, Apple, Microsoft**.
