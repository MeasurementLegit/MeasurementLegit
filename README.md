# :wave: Hello Everyone! Take as much time as you want!

There's no time limit, feel free to see my profile as long as you want. Anyway, I'm Vanza Setia, a passionate teenager (18 years old) on frontend web development who likes following best practices when doing Frontend Mentor projects and helping people by giving them feedback. **I have done over 15 projects and given over 300 feedback on Frontend Mentor**.

If you haven't joined [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) yet, then I highly recommend you to join the community. It's **free**, **beginner friendly**, and **also help you show your skill**.

My goal is to have a **full time job in a company as a Junior Frontend Web Developer**.

Besides coding, I also enjoy reading comics and playing video games. :smile:
